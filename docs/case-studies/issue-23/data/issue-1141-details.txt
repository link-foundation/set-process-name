We also need to ensure we use all best practices from: https://github.com/link-foundation/js-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template, and also make sure ESLint also checks for lines, and has error if lines are more than 1500.

If we can improve https://github.com/link-foundation/js-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template in any way we should report issues there.

Please download all logs and data related about the issue to this repository, make sure we compile that data to `./docs/case-studies/issue-{id}` folder, and use it to do deep case study analysis (also make sure to search online for additional facts and data), in which we will reconstruct timeline/sequence of events, find root causes of the problem, and propose possible solutions.
